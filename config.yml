      Welcome to my website. My name is Austin Godber. I have a bachelors in 
      [Physics from Arizona State University](https://physics.asu.edu). I am a
      Software Engineer and Site Reliability Engineer. I have worked
      on DARPA sponsored computer security projects, helped start a Municipal
      WiFi company, assisted NASA's Mars Spaceflight Facility in surviving the
      Slashdot effect, wrangled virtual penguins for JumpBox, operated cameras
      on NASA's [MER](http://pancam.sese.asu.edu/index.html) and 
      [MSL Mars](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/msl-curiosity/) rovers and now
      build and manage
