Welcome to my page for my üåµ‚öæÔ∏è tickets for the [2025 Spring Training season for
the San Francisco Giants](https://www.sfgiants.com/springtraining) at
Scottsdale Stadium. 

## The Calendar

The calendar and table below shows the ticket availability for the 2025 Spring
Training season.

## The Seats

I have four seats in Section 103, Row A Seat 6, and Row B
Seats 5, 6, and 7.  This section sits right behind home plate, so it's a great
place to watch the game.

## FAQ

### How do I know what tickets are available?

Look at the calendar above. Each game is colored:

* Green: All four tickets are available
* Red: No tickets are available
* Yellow: Some tickets are available, but not all four

The L shaped boxes represent the seats and their availability.  Green means the
seat is available, red means it's not.  Hover over a seat to see the seat
number.  If you're on mobile, you can tap on a seat to see the seat number.

Note that the calendar is not being updated immediately.  So don't wait too long
to request tickets after checking it.  I'll try to update it as soon as I can
but I make no guarantees.

### How do I request tickets?

Send me an email or text with the following information:

* Your name
* Which game you want tickets for
* Which seats you want tickets for: `103A6`, `103B5`, `103B6`, or `103B7`
* What email address you use in the MLB Ballpark app

If you don't know who I am, you'll have to go to SeatGeek and buy tickets from
me there.  Maybe I will find a way to share those tickets here.

### How will I receive the tickets?

You must use the MLB Ballpark app and I will send you tickets via the app.

### Where do I park?

Parking is tough, go super early and park near the stadium or in the Library if
they still let you do that.  There's abundant parking over on Goldwater just north of Osborn.  That's about a 10 minute walk to the stadium.
